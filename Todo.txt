Ranking: 
Calculate datapoint distance & cluster distance [Euclidean] from ideal point, make weighted average ranks
Spearman correlation across results
Analyse the relevant rankings (HDI correlations)
    Cluster average characteristics (means, deviations)
    Analyse specific differences (percentile [cluster as datapoint], qualitative analyses, HDI)

Validation: (â‰¥3)

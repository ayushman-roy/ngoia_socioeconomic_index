            pearson correlation // pca vaildation
                pca selections -> 2d/3d/explained variance, validate with elbow
                    pca
                        min-max {remove ideal from k-means analysis}
                            train-test (transfer pca weights) / 100% train
                                k means // 3,5,10 clusters + silhouette, validate with elbow

3 pca -> 2 test/train -> 3 k means => 18 results

Ranking: [3]
calculate datapoint distance & cluster distance [euclidean] from ideal point, make weighted average ranks
spearman correlation across results
select best 3 for analysis (HDI differences across k means, silhouette scores)
    cluster average characteristics (means, deviations)
    analyse specific differences (percentile [cluster as datapoint], qualitative analyses, HDI)

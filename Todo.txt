Analysis:  
        z-score
            pearson correlation // pca vaildation
                pca selections & apply-> 3d/explained variance and elbow 
                        min-max {remove ideal from k-means space}
                            train-test splits // 100% train
                                k means // silhouette and elbow

Ranking: 
Calculate datapoint distance & cluster distance [Euclidean] from ideal point, make weighted average ranks
Spearman correlation across results
Analyse the relevant rankings (HDI correlations)
    Cluster average characteristics (means, deviations)
    Analyse specific differences (percentile [cluster as datapoint], qualitative analyses, HDI)

Validation: (â‰¥3) 
Correlate with satellite based electricity usage ///
Vehicle/transport related data ///
Increase in public service output (hospitals, offices, factories etc.) ///
Track complaints per district (writing to the govt) ///
Population growth data ///

Deliverable: 
Write paper (key questions addressed, lit review, {project explaination}, further research, limitations)
